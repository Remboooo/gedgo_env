    "Ged-go is written in Django with d3.js visualizations, based on the idea "
    "that a genealogy website and gedcom viewer can be beautiful and "
    "intuitive.\n\n"
    "Most of the web-based genealogy software out there is pretty ugly and "
    "difficult to navigate in.  There are often silly little icons and "
    "information is presented in hard to read tables.  Instead, the "
    "philosophy of Ged-go is to have fewer features, but to present a gedcom "
    "in a clear and well designed way."
